# useCallback

The only reason you would ever want to use the callback hook is if you need to worry about referential equality, which is very similar to why you you would use useMemo so as you can see in the code, the getItems function changes every time because we create a brand new function but with useCallback, we are not creating a new function unless we need to, so the referential equality of getItems from the time it rendered and getItems the next time it rendered is going to be the same as long as the number in the dependencies array doesn't actually change. This is moreso about referential equality problems and almost always it's going to be when you are using some other hook like useEffect or useMemo when we need to have that value inside the dependencies array.
