# Code Splitting

## Bundling

Most React apps will have their files “bundled” using tools like Webpack, Rollup or Browserify. Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a “bundle”. This bundle can then be included on a webpage to load an entire app at once.

## Code Splitting

Code-splitting your app can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven’t reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you’ve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load.

## `import()`

The best way to introduce code-splitting into your app is through the dynamic import() syntax.

When Webpack comes across this syntax, it automatically starts code-splitting your app. If you’re using Create React App, this is already configured for you and you can start using it immediately. It’s also supported out of the box in Next.js.

When using Babel, you’ll need to make sure that Babel can parse the dynamic import syntax but is not transforming it. For that you will need @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import.

## React.lazy

The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.

`const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));`

This will automatically load the bundle containing the OtherComponent when this component is first rendered.

React.lazy takes a function that must call a dynamic import(). This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.

The lazy component should then be rendered inside a Suspense component, which allows us to show some fallback content (such as a loading indicator) while we’re waiting for the lazy component to load.

## Error boundaries

If the other module fails to load (for example, due to network failure), it will trigger an error. You can handle these errors to show a nice user experience and manage recovery with Error Boundaries. Once you’ve created your Error Boundary, you can use it anywhere above your lazy components to display an error state when there’s a network error.

```js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import MyErrorBoundary from './MyErrorBoundary';

const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
const AnotherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./AnotherComponent'));

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <MyErrorBoundary>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <section>
          <OtherComponent />
          <AnotherComponent />
        </section>
      </Suspense>
    </MyErrorBoundary>
  </div>
);
```

## Route-based code splitting

Deciding where in your app to introduce code splitting can be a bit tricky. You want to make sure you choose places that will split bundles evenly, but won’t disrupt the user experience.

A good place to start is with routes. Most people on the web are used to page transitions taking some amount of time to load. You also tend to be re-rendering the entire page at once so your users are unlikely to be interacting with other elements on the page at the same time.

Here’s an example of how to setup route-based code splitting into your app using libraries like React Router with React.lazy.

```js
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const Home = lazy(() => import('./routes/Home'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./routes/About'));

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  </Router>
);
```

## Named Exports

React.lazy currently only supports default exports. If the module you want to import uses named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. This ensures that tree shaking keeps working and that you don’t pull in unused components.
